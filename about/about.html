            <h1>Our mission</h1>
            <h2>Serving our community since 2015</h2>
            <p>Kat Kafe is a cozy haven in the heart of Queens, where volunteers
                work tirelessly to provide a home for cats in need and promote responsible pet ownership. As the
                only non-profit cat cafe in the area, we are dedicated to reducing cat homelessness through
                adoption, education, and outreach programs. With each cup of coffee or pastry purchased, patrons
                directly contribute to our mission of giving cats a second chance at a loving home. Step inside
                and meet our playful resident cats, each with their own unique personality
                waiting to steal your heart.</p>

            <h1>Our impact</h1>
            <h2>Since 2015, we have rescued over 5000 cats</h2>
            <p>Kat Kafe operated by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), has
                become a transformative force in the fight against cat homelessness in New York City. Since its inception,
                Kat Kafe has not only served as a warm and inviting space for visitors but has also significantly impacted
                the lives of countless cats. With over 100,000 visitors welcomed through our doors, we've successfully
                connected cats in need with loving forever homes, reducing the burden of homelessness on our city's streets.</p>
            <p>One of our proudest achievements is the ASPCA Rescue Clinic, which has provided essential veterinary services
                and performed over 3,000 spay/neuter surgeries. These efforts have not only improved the health and well-being
                of individual cats but have also contributed to the long-term solution of reducing cat overpopulation in New
                York City. Through our cafe, we've empowered our community to take action in addressing cat homelessness.</p>
            <p>As we continue our mission, we invite others to join us in creating a future where every cat has a place to call home.</p>

            <h1>Our history</h1>
            <h2>How we started</h2>
            <p>In 2015, a group of passionate rescuers within the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
                (ASPCA) came up with a singular goal: to enhance the lives of Queens' homeless animals. Initially focused on providing low-cost veterinary services and fostering networks
                for rescued cats, we faced a significant challenge due to the absence of a centralized space for fostering
                families, potential adopters, and rescuers. Thus, Kat Kafe emerged in February 2019 as a beacon of hope.</p>
            <h2>How we built our foundation</h2>
            <p>Since our grand opening, Kat Kafe has become much more than a mere cafe; it's become a sanctuary and a lifeline
                for countless animals in need. Managed primarily by ASPCA directors and dedicated volunteers, the cafe has
                welcomed over 15,000 visitors annually, cementing its status as a beloved fixture in the community. Beyond
                facilitating adoptions, Kat Kafe serves as an educational hub, offering workshops and providing refuge for
                newly rescued cats.</p>
            <h2>Our ongoing mission</h2>
            <p>Amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we've adapted our mission to meet the evolving needs
                of our community. With a renewed focus on expanding our foster program, the cafe now houses approximately 100
                cats in foster homes at any given time, thanks to the generosity of our dedicated supporters. Additionally,
                the launch of a low-cost medical clinic in 2022 provided essential veterinary services to recent rescues,
                ensuring that even more animals receive the care they deserve. Through these initiatives and more, we hope to
                make a lasting impact.</p>
